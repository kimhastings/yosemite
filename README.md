# Yosemite Recreation Map

## Introduction

This project was created as an assignment for the Udacity Front-end Nanodegree program.

## Using the Map

You will need a way to serve the map. [These instructions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) from our friends at Mozilla explain how to set up a simple local HTTP server.

Instructions for me:

Open the integrated terminal in VS code.
Type: python -m http.server
Go to the URL localhost:8000 in your web browser
If you get uncaught referrer error, remember to TEMPORARILY enable localhost for your API key [here](https://console.developers.google.com)
Use CTRL-C to kill the server
