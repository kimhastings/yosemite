# Yosemite Recreation Map

## Introduction

This project was created as an assignment for the Udacity Front-end Nanodegree program.

## Using the Map

Click [here](https://kimhastings.github.io/yosemite/) to open a hosted version of the map in your browser.

For debugging, you will need a way to serve the map. [These instructions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) from our friends at Mozilla explain how to set up a simple local HTTP server.

Instructions for me:

1. Open the integrated terminal in VS code.
2. Type: python -m http.server
3. Go to the URL localhost:8000 in your web browser

If you get an uncaught referrer error, remember to TEMPORARILY enable localhost for your API key [here](https://console.developers.google.com).

Use CTRL-C to kill the server, then restart it, to see the results of edits.
